## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- git

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sql-scanner.git
cd sql-scanner

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/sql-scanner.git

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov flake8 black isort

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_detector.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v tests/
```

### Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code with Black
black .

# Sort imports with isort
isort .

# Lint with flake8
flake8 .

# Type checking (if using mypy)
mypy .
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with these specifics:

- **Line length**: 100 characters (not 79)
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for strings, double for docstrings
- **Naming**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/variables: `snake_case`
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`

### Code Example

```python
"""
Module docstring describing the module purpose
"""

import sys
from typing import List, Optional

from .config import MAX_URLS

class MyScanner:
    """Class docstring describing the class"""
    
    def __init__(self, target: str):
        """Initialize scanner with target URL"""
        self.target = target
        self.results: List[dict] = []
    
    def scan(self, url: str) -> Optional[dict]:
        """
        Scan a single URL
        
        Args:
            url: The URL to scan
            
        Returns:
            Dictionary with results or None if failed
        """
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

### Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings
- **Comments**: Explain *why*, not *what*
- **Type hints**: Use where appropriate
- **README**: Update if adding features

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain >80% code coverage
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use descriptive test names

```python
def test_mysql_error_detection_with_single_quote():
    """Test that MySQL errors are detected with single quote payload"""
    # Arrange
    detector = VulnerabilityDetector()
    response_text = "SQL syntax error near '1'='1'"
    
    # Act
    vulnerable, db_type, _, _ = detector.detect_error_based(
        response_text, "' OR '1'='1"
    )
    
    # Assert
    assert vulnerable is True
    assert db_type == 'MySQL'
```

## üìù Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding/updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

fix(crawler): handle SSL certificate errors gracefully

Previously, the crawler would crash on SSL errors.
Now it catches the exception and continues.

Fixes #38

Added troubleshooting section for common install issues
```

### Commit Best Practices

- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Capitalize subject line
- No period at end of subject
- Separate subject from body with blank line
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Explain *what* and *why*, not *how*
